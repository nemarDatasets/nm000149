## Abstract

We show that persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain decodable neural correlates of attempted arm and hand movements. We investigated hand open, palmar grasp, lateral grasp, pronation, and supination in 10 persons with cervical SCI. Discriminative movement information was provided by the time-domain of low-frequency electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Based on these signals, we obtained a maximum average classification accuracy of 45% (chance level was 20%) with respect to the five investigated classes. Pattern analysis indicates central motor areas as the origin of the discriminative signals. Furthermore, we introduce a proof-of-concept to classify movement attempts online in a closed loop, and tested it on a person with cervical SCI. We achieved here a modest classification performance of 68.4% with respect to palmar grasp vs hand open (chance level 50%).

## Methodology

10 participants with cervical SCI were recruited from a rehabilitation center (AUVA rehabilitation clinic, Tobelbad, Austria). Participants were aged 20-78 years with neurological level of injury C1-C7 and AIS scores A-D. They sat in wheelchairs and attempted/executed movements based on visual cues shown on screen. Each trial lasted 5 seconds with a fixation cross and beep at start, class cue displayed at 2 seconds. 9 runs with 40 trials per run were recorded (360 trials total, 72 per class). EEG was recorded from 61 electrodes using g.tec g.USBamps and g.GAMMAsys/g.LADYbird active electrode system at 256 Hz with 0.01-100 Hz bandpass and 50 Hz notch filter. Preprocessing included visual inspection, ICA artifact removal, trial rejection, and 0.3-3 Hz bandpass filtering. Classification used shrinkage LDA with 10x10 cross-validation. Online proof-of-concept used modified training paradigm with ready/go cues and 3-class classifier (hand open, palmar grasp, rest) with pre/post class detection logic.
